## Research

### Picard Iterations with Deep Learning for MV-FBSDEs
* Proposed Picard iteration based numerical method for the solution of Mckean-Vlasov Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations.
  Deep learning is used to elicit the solution to the backwards component and to represent the Mckean-Vlasov terms.
* Work done as an International Visiting Graduate Student at the University of Toronto, under advisorship by Professor Sebastian Jaimungal.
* Presented at the [Eastern Conference in Mathematical Finance](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/24-25/mathematical-finance), at the Fields Institute. Article in the oven :)
* [Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15eoCqOfXFapm0R-zd-B0TvatalXWTbnK/view?usp=sharing), [code](https://github.com/fjpAntunes/mean-field-tools/tree/main/mean_field_tools/deep_bsde)

### A Mean Field Game Model for Educational Choices
* Proposed a model for the interaction of the  macroeconomic state of a population and the individual time allocation between work or education. End goal of the research is to simulate public policies tackling school evasion in Brazil.
* Advisorship by Professor Yuri Saporito (FGV EMAp)
* Presented as [PhD qualification dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15bJPnQ-lry8X4zOKi8EJCNh7QhL9reFW/view?usp=sharing). Article in the oven :) 
* Presented at [Research in Options 2023](https://eventos.fgv.br/research-options-2023) conference, at FGV.

### Modeling and Control of Malaria Dynamics in Fish Farming Regions
* Worked in a multidisciplinary research group from FGV and Fiocruz to develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of malaria and its relation to fish farming in Acre. Model shows that fish farming tanks maintenance is a viable intervention to reduce the incidence of malaria.
* Advisorship by Professor Soledad Aronna (FGV EMAp) and Professor Claudia Code√ßo (Fiocruz)
* Originally presented as [master's dissertation](https://repositorio.fgv.br/items/e130eeeb-9c6f-43e9-80fc-249299261dac) at FGV EMAp.
* [Published at SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems (2023).](https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1376698)
